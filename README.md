# Mes Velibs  

##Synopsis

Quick and dirty page to only show Velib (Paris Bike Sharing) near my flat.
I created this because, I am a big Velib user and I wanted the fastest way to check availabilities near my flat.

Just change the velibs ID une the urls at the end of `index.html` file to make it your own.

get your Api key [here](https://developer.jcdecaux.com) and replace it at the end of each urls
